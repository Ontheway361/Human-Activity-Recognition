In our survey paper, we group the approaches based on deep learning into three categories, e.g. sequence-based, view-based, depth-based. For the sequence-based approaches, their intrinsic characteristic is transforming the sequences with variable length to fixed dimension label. For the view-based approaches, which focus on the generation, combination and factorization of different views. For the depth-based approaches, they study the transformation of representation from one space to another.

# Introduction
This repo contains the brief introduction of our survey paper : A Gentle Review of Deep Learning based Human Activity Recognition. In this section we will introduce the outline of each categories.

## Sequence-based
In this section, we list the two streams of methods that transform the sequence with variable length to fixed dimension. One is RNN(LSTM)-related approaches, the other is temporal aggregation related approaches.
